Common Library
==============



Branching
---------

Development for the common library is done on the master branch. Once the first
product is release using the common library, an 'r1' branch will be made. When
an incompatible change is introduced to the common library, an 'r2' branch will
be made.

This allows client programs to choose when to upgrade from 'r1' to 'r2', which
by definition will require client code changes.
