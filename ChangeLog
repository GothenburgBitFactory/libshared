- Datetime no longer users 23:59:59 as EOD, but 24:00:00. All date ranges should
  therefore be [...) instead of [...].
- Datetime now uses whole days, not 86400 seconds for calculating date offsets.
- Datetime now properly calculates day names when looking backwards.
- Datetime considerѕ forwards/backwards when calculating informal time.
